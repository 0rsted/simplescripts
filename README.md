# simplescripts
Small scripts/pages that I use for stuff

## overview of files
- [`idArch.htm`](idArch.htm)   
  html file that tries to id if you're running windows or mac, and finding the 
  architecture of the CPU.   
  it's quite big, because it includes base64 images, I haven't tested it on 
  apple silicon, but windows works, and mobile platforms are just denied.   
- [`simpleclock.htm`](simpleclock.htm)   
  html file that renders a digital clock with date, it tries to take up all 
  horizontal space for the clock and date.   
  it's in danish
  it can take some arguments in the querystring, to remove seconds and change
  the color of the font.  
  it uses apples SF Pro Display font for easy readability
